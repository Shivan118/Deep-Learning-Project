What is ANN? Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a supervised learning system built of a large number of simple elements, called neurons or perceptrons. Each neuron can make simple decisions, and feeds those decisions to other neurons, organized in interconnected layers.

The basic functioning of Artificial Neural Net(ANN) is inspired by working of biological neuron. Human brain learns as a result of getting trained by sample data initially. For example, we learn to call a fruit-apple after initally getting “trained” to see the apple as object in real life or it’s image.

The most simple neural network is the “perceptron”, which, in its simplest form, consists of a single neuron. Much like biological neurons, which have dendrites and axons, the single artificial neuron is a simple tree structure which has input nodes and a single output node, which is connected to each input node.

What is Activation Function? If we do not apply a Activation function then the output signal would simply be a simple linear function.A linear function is just a polynomial of one degree. Now, a linear equation is easy to solve but they are limited in their complexity and have less power to learn complex functional mappings from data. A Neural Network without Activation function would simply be a Linear regression Model, which has limited power and does not performs good most of the times

# The CIFAR-10 dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.

# Develop a single Neuron Model to Convert C to F ( ANN First Project )
In this project, we will build a simple machine learning model to convert temperatures from Celsius to fahernehit.
The Euation is as follows:
T(*F) = T(*C) * 9/5 + 32
